# ASB - Assistent Subsystem for Backpacks

ASB is a assistent inspired by mobile assistants such as Google Home, Siri, Alexa, and the integrated assistant device [Jacquard](https://atap.google.com/jacquard/). 

It has similar functionality, with the exception of doing everything offline and being controlled by buttons on the strap of a backpack. 

It uses python to manage everything, from the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi, to the Text To Speech, to the music, to the tools inside.

As of now, it can 
* Play, pause, skip, and shuffle downloaded music
* Create timers
* Start stop, and read a stopwatch
* Start, stop, and switch sounds of a metronome

In the future I plan to add
* Navigation via openstreetmaps
* Sync calendar, todo and other information with a laptop or computer via Bluetooth

I will write a detailed instructions on how to install, configure the software, as well as creaet the simple circuitboards for the buttons, and maybe how to sew the custom backpack I sewed for the ASB
